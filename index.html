<p> <h2>Dear Friends,<br>
Warm Greetings to you!</h2>
The term 'education' encompasses more than just knowledge and knowing. It is a harmonious blend of academia, arts, sports, emotions, attitudes, creativity, nature and life itself! And in the world we have built today, the one who is adept in all these areas is the one who succeeds.As an educator I had an earnest desire to build up an institution where an education blended in all colors of human values could be given and today I feel proud to say that my lofty dream of a quality institution is taking shape through it.  we belive.."Quality education to every single child"we started this school with the same ambition  
.The foundation of school was led in 1983.</p>
<p>The school started with 3 teachers and 100 students and now he have 
200 staff members and about 10000 students.The journey was neaver easy but the inspiration
that the quality education should reach to every single child .I have always believed that, "Excellence is never an accident; it's always the result of high intention, sincere efforts, intelligent direction and skilful execution." 
keeps us motivating.</p>

With warm regards,<br>
Ramesh Mane,<br>

<h2>Hello friends,</h2>
<p> 
Its our privelage to say. The reputation, the school has acquired and established over these years is due to the dedication and selfless commitment of teachers, supporting staff, and the students. With the support of the staff and families, our students explore, express and excel academically and creatively. I appreciate the dedication and the selfless service of the teachers of the past and the present and wish them all, best of fortune, peace and prosperity for their contribution to the noble task of spreading education and its manifest qualities, aims and objectives.
our school cares for the individual development of each and every student.</p>
<p> We accord prime importance to the behavioral discipline, moral integrity and cognitive developments of our students. Our teachers strive to teach not only academic programmes but also life skills needed for students’ self development with highly resourceful faculty.I believe my role as an educator is to guide and nurture the next generation to establish skills to achieve health, respect, prosperity and fulfillment.
I am passionate about students being empowered to succeed.
