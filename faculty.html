<p>Teaching is an underappreciated profession! Without teachers, we wouldn’t have doctors, lawyers, CEOs, engineers, authors the list goes on.Our teachers go through additional schooling, work nights and weekends, and somehow have a knack for holding on to
 their sanity while dealing with other people’s kids. 
Teachers of our school completely rework what teaching looks like, to work tirelessly to connect to students and families and to do it with passion, flexibility and grace shows me how deeply invested they are in teaching and nurturing our 360 students.
Teachers feel responsible for the learning and the well-being of each one of their students. They worry about their emotional welfare and health of childrens
. They build science kits in their garage for families, hoping to keep them engaged in learning. They wait for their own children to go to bed so they can record new lessons for math and reading. They hand deliver materials to front 
porches. They work in teams to learn new platforms and apps. They continue to reach out to families that don’t respond. They call students to offer them words of encouragement and reassure them.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm
It has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can create a positive learning experience.
Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm are more likely to have engaged, interested and energetic students who are curious about learning the subject matter. Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.
</p>
<p>Interaction with learners
Research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships. Our enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students. Their ability to create effective learning environments that foster student ach
ievement depends on the kind of relationship they build with their students.
Useful teacher-to-student interactions are crucial in linking academic success with personal achievement.Here, personal success is a student's internal goal of improving themselves, whereas academic success includes the goals they receive from their superior. A teacher must guide their student i
n aligning their personal goals with their academic goals. Students who receive this positive influence show stronger self-confidence and greater personal and academic success than those without these teacher interactions.


Students are likely to build stronger relations with teachers who are friendly and supportive and will show more interest in courses taught by these teachers.Teachers that spend more time interacting and working directly with students are perceived as supportive and effective teachers
. Effective teachers have been shown to invite student participation and decision making, allow humor into their classroom, and demonstrate a willingness to play.


Studying teacher's effect on students in the context of Western music composition, research indicates that the quality of creative output of a student is positively affected if the teacher is of good quality. Likewise, the quality of a student's creative output is affected negatively if the teacher is of bad quality.
 Research also shows that the influence of a teacher on the student's creative output lasts for (up to) twenty years.</p>
